# Sander's Notebooks

This repository is to hold (Jupyter) notebooks I have created that I
think may be interesting for others.

* [Using Git](using_git/using_git.ipynb) - An introduction to the
  internals of Git, how Git operations affect them, and what that
  means for undoing and recovering stuff.
