# Sander's Notebooks

This repository is to hold (Jupyter) notebooks I have created that I
think may be interesting for others.

* [Using Git](using_git/using_git.ipynb) - An introduction to the
  internals of Git, how Git operations affect them, and what that
  means for undoing and recovering stuff.

* [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement_learning/reinforcement_learning.ipynb) -
  An overview on the theorie of Reinforcement Learning with some
  example code, and pointers to cool new developments such as Deep
  RL. As presented at the
  [London Self-Driving/Autonomous Car Technology Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-Self-Driving-Autonomous-Car-Technology-Meetup/).
  
Each notebook has its requirements file to install packages needed to
run the notebook yourself:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Jupyter is assumed to already be installed.
